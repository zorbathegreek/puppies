They are located in Rusizi (Cyangugu); because you may find it difficult to pass by and have a look, we have some videos (here), (here) and (here). We will update these videos from time to time.

If you are interested to get one of them, you can leave your details (here). Please specify which one or which type you would prefer (ridge/no ridge, short/long hair, etc), which sex (m/f), and other features that you find important.

They will be vaccinated at two and three months against rabies and the common preventable diseases, dewormed regularly,  etc. 

We will screen with a Volhardt Test at 7 weeks and videoshoot that, and make these videos available to those people who are interested.
